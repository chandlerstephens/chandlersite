          <p>I’m just a small-town girl pursuing my dream of sharing my passion for songwriting and singing songs that inspire me and hopefully others. And so for me, it was inevitable that I would chance the road to Nashville.</p>

          <p>Growing up I was exposed to all kinds of music – country, pop, soul, but it was always emotionally impactful lyrics and deeply memorable melodies that became infectiously imbedded in my mind, my heart and my soul. They consumed me and to this day drive my ever-waking moment. I sing in the shower and my bathroom mirror is my audience as I put on make-up. I sing driving my car and walking my dogs.</p>

          <p>In grade school I found myself listening to mostly country music on the radio and I remember being moved by really great singers like Faith, Reba and Martina and in eighth grade I spent hours studying and listening to the amazing country artists Patsy Cline, Tammy Wynette, and Loretta Lynn who paved the way for country music.</p>

          <p>I grew up in Lake Mary, Florida in a pretty big family, and when I say pretty big, it’s a bit of an understatement. I have sixteen siblings and fifteen of them are adopted. Overall my parents have seventeen children. My younger brother and I are the only two biological children. People always ask me the question “what was it like being in such a big family, and having so many adopted siblings”? My response for the most part was “it was crazy, but so much fun”.</p>

          <p>By the time I turned seven, adoptions just became normal to me as my parents welcomed new children into our home on an annual basis. I just kept gaining new siblings, which was awesome. It was so normal to me that when I first moved to Nashville, silence was weird and calm was strange. To me chaos was comforting. I had grown up with so many siblings and there was so much going on all the time. I loved having so many siblings. I always had someone to talk to; but with any big family sometimes you need your alone time, and that was when I would go in my room and listen to music. Music was my escape, it was a place I could go and just listen, and sing along as loud as I wanted, and no one would tell me to “shush” or “pipe down” like my brother sometimes would; because I was walking around the house singing at the top of my lungs. I remember I would randomly burst into song and my dad would say, “You need to project”‘. He always wanted me to have a better, stronger voice.</p>

          <p>My mom was also very influential in my love for music. She formed a band when I was nine years old. The band was made up of some of her siblings, and a couple of friends. The band was named Rain of Renewal and I remember going to their shows, standing in the front row jamming out singing every word. It was the coolest thing, and I was like “that’s what I want to do; I want to sing”! This never seemed like a realistic career option for me, but rather a dream. So, I went through high school still loving music and singing all the time, even if it was just myself as the audience in my car driving to school.</p>

          <p>When I graduated I went to Southeastern University to study psychology, I was planning on being a counselor for children. After my first semester I decided college wasn’t really for me. I wanted to pursue music. I realized I could do the same thing I wanted to do to help children and people in general without the degree. So, I finished up my first year of college and then packed up all of my belongings and moved to Nashville in 2013. Fast forward to present day – I am here pursuing my lifelong dream of creating music that touches and changes the world one heart at a time.</p>
